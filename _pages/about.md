I am Darius, a Lisbon-based tech and nature enthusiast from Transylvania, Romania. 

After finishing my studies in horticulture, I worked in jobs ranging from hydroponics and greenhouse farming to wine-making and landscape gardening.     
I transitioned to the tech industry, gaining experience as a front-end and back-end software developer.

I get passionate about way too many things: gardening, mushrooms, psychology, social engineering, psychedelics, dogs with sunglasses and dog-watching, to name a few.

Nowadays, I am teaching myself cybersecurity, looking to get into that field one (ethical) way or another.
