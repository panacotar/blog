I decided to document my journey into this new field. Here is part one, talking about why and how I started.

There are multiple reason to keeping a public account of this journey. Besides keeping me accountable, it hopefully might help some others who are on the same journey.

The first time security as a tool for good impressed me was after seeing the documentary *Roll Red Roll* in 2018.   
It is a dark story about a small Ohio town where guys from the football team sexually assaulted a girl. Because that team was beloved by the community, the teachers, coaches, and parents were hiding information and even calling the lady a liar. There was no hope for her to get justice, until a hacker group found the deleted videos and other evidence. They posted it to the public and got the guys convicted.    
This story stayed with me for a long time. It got me wondering how obtaining those deleted evidence was even possible. But back then, I was not very confident in my abilities and saw it as something for "smart" people only.

Not long after, I transitioned to software developing, I gathered experience and finally got to a place where I felt comfortable and confident in my skills.  
I focused more on Ruby/Rails and collaborated on different applications. Security was one aspect of development, although never the main one. More of an afterthought, but it always drew my attention. I wasn't aware of the opportunities it presented.    

I kept reading news about various data breaches and cyber-attacks on large companies (Uber, Twitter, etc.) and hearing from acquaintances about them getting hacked. It showed the topicality of security.

In 2023, I started dedicating time to transitioning to this new field. Gaining skills in Web Security (as I was more familiar with the subject).   
Only now, I'm starting to write down the steps I took. In part 2, I will talk more about the journey until now.
