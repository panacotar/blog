I'm continuing the [practice]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-01-03-2023-annual-review %}) of reflecting on the year that passed.

Looking back at 2024, I will answer these questions:
1. **What went well this year?**
2. **What didn't go so well this year?**
3. **What am I working towards?**


## 1. **What went well this year?**
### My travel in South America
This travel has been on my plan for a very long time, and I'm so happy to finally be able to do it.   
It's been ten months of wandering in this beautiful continent. During this time, I met so many lovely people and made some special connections, even started building a relationship. My Spanish improved here, I'm comfortable even with having more advanced conversations. It's hard to capture here my whole journey.    
I volunteered in a hostel in Montevideo for around five weeks, then at a homestead outside Buenos Aires, and at a dog shelter for a month in Peru.  

I've spent quite some time in Uruguay. They have a wonderful tech community here, it pleasantly surprised me by how ample it is, I've been to some Ruby meetups and one of them had around 50-60 participants. They were all so welcoming and approachable, they even applauded me for being from Romania. For sure, they are doing a great job with binding the community.   
The infosec community is not lacking here also, there are almost monthly OWASP meetups, culminating with the December meetup by [OWASP Rio de la Plata](https://appsecriodelaplata.org/). There were around 600 participants and lots of awesome speakers. The talks were in Spanish, but I was able to understand them (ok, maybe around 80% of what was going on).

### Letting go of social anxiety
As I traveled almost this entire year, the socializing opportunities were all around. I was looking for hostels stays. Although intense at times, being in this highly social environment is beneficial for building social skills.   
All this helped me become comfortable with new spaces, approaching people I don't know yet. I can say it even builds resilience by adapting to the unknown and different way of thinking people have.    

The ability to meet people, form connections and exchange ideas is so important. Maybe even more essential in the era of AI where being replaced is a sure threat for everybody. That's why I'm stressing fine-tuning these abilities.

### My first contribution to an open-source project
Another thing I had under my radar for a long time. Contributing to open-source projects felt always intimidating. This past year I committed to this, got over my insecurities, and made it happened.    
My very first contribution went into the Casa project from [Ruby for Good](https://rubyforgood.org/) organization. This is a group of tech professionals who create software solutions for social good.

The maintainers were patient and communicated well, resulting in a positive experience.

Soon after, I did other contributions towards Casa and another Ruby for Good project, Human Essentials.    

In the future, I intend to contribute more towards these positive projects. I recommend this to everybody who is thinking about contributing, just take the leap. It is an awesome way to shape your skills, meet others in this field and learn from people more advanced than you.

## 2. **What didn't go so well this year?**
This was a truly positive year, and I have no regrets. It took me a while thinking about what would fall under this header.    
But there are some things that can be mentioned. 
### Not having a routine to learn cybersec
Traveling and changing places so often is not conducive to following a routine while learning. I didn't enjoy as much time as I wanted to sit down and learn more about this field. I was focussing on exploring my surrounding, meeting people, and improving my social skills. This made the most sense as I was fortunate enough to be in this travel and wanted to take advantage of it.

Nevertheless, I didn't fully stop learning. I spent most of the time on the Hack The Box platform as they have some of the best learning resources and labs I found.    
I managed to finished their "Information Security Foundations" path and almost all "SOC Analyst" job role path, plus other misc resources. This encompasses around 22 completed modules.

### Not being consistent with sport/physical exercise
This is again related to lacking a routine. Besides some hiking in nature and exploring the cities by foot, I haven't practice physical exercise as often as I wanted.    
This lack of exercise catches on me and I feel I'm becoming more sluggish. That is not just physical, but mental as well. Even my creativity gets affected after a while.     
What I realized is that I don't like closed indoor gyms (except maybe the bouldering walls) and I'm not a big fan of running in a city close to so many cars.


## 3. **What am I working towards?**
### Continue my cybersec journey (getting certified)
I'm committed to this transition and there are so many new things to learn. This time of traveling allowed me to explore this field better. Playing around with different aspects of cybersecurity, I'm now leaning more on the Blue teaming/defensive security. This is generally considered a more boring side of the cybersec, but for some reasons it caught on me. I don't find it boring at all. Finding ways to harden a system, analyzing a malware, or searching the logs for post-attack artifacts all sounds fascinating. And even more, wondering of ways to integrate AI into this.    
Blue teaming is in itself a grand system, and I'm still figuring out my place in it. Inspired by some people in the cybersec space, I started documenting my journey in this field.

### Connecting with professionals in the cybersec space
Simply gathering knowledge is not enough, meeting colleagues is an essential part. I realized I don't personally know many people in this field, maybe there are two I can think of. When I switched to programming, I was in the same spot, but eventually I got to build a good network of mentors and peers.    
These next years, I'm looking to do the same the for cybersecurity field.

### More contributing to open-source projects
After my initial contribution, I recognized it's potential for learning. You get access to a legacy project which has more advanced issues. These complex issues will challenge you when finding way to solve it. It also improves the communication and collaboration skills, if you're stuck, you can get help from the team. Also, as the code and git history is public, you can see how others have solved more complex issues before.    
For the future, I'm looking to contribute more on these projects, more focussed on the ones related to cybersecurity and ruby/rails.
