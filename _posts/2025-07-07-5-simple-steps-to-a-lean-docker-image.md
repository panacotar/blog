title: 5 simple steps to a lean Docker image
tags: vps docker
---

Docker is a tool I often use, both for developing personal projects and also during my [Cybersec studies]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2024-10-28-place-an-ssh-honeypot %}). Recently, I researched how Docker builds an image and discovered ways to limit the image size.

This came after I set up a separate, basic VPS for testing stuff that quickly ran out of storage. Instead of simply upgrading the VPS storage, I went for frugality and optimized my Docker images.

Here are some basic first steps you can take to limit the image size. I tried keeping these steps language agnostic, but I'll use a Node app to exemplify the concepts.

The build command I used:
```
docker build --no-cache -t node-api:v0 .
```
After each step, you'll see *the image size and build time*. Notice that the build time may vary based on your system, network connection, time of day, and how depressed your machine is.

### Initial build
I'm starting from this Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
FROM node:latest

WORKDIR /usr/src/node-api

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --verbose

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
```
Size:
node-api     v0        1.43GB
Time
Building 17.2s (12/12)
```

## Steps
### 1. Ignore files

With `.dockerignore`. Placed in the root directory.   
This speeds up the build and also prevents sensitive files from showing up in the final image.

Here are some more details on [syntax](https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#syntax).
```
Size:
node-api     v1        1.37GB
Time:
Building 15.3s (12/12)
```

### 2. Base Image

This has a major impact on the size of the final image.   
The main frameworks offer different image tags to use. Go for the leaner images, as you can save on storage, but this may come with a caveat.

For Node, use `alpine` images instead of `latest`.    
Alpine-based images are popular for their minimal size and smaller vulnerability count. They are not officially supported by the Node team though. See the list of [unofficial Node builds](https://github.com/nodejs/unofficial-builds/).    
Alpine project uses [musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/) to implement the C standard library, whereas Debianâ€™s Node.js tags (for instance `bullseye` or `slim`) rely on the `glibc`. For this reason, it might cause compatibility issues with dependencies that include native code.    
However, `alpine` will suffice for most projects.

I downloaded some common Node image tags to compare them:
```
REPOSITORY               TAG               SIZE
node                     latest            1.13GB
node                     bookworm          1.13GB
node                     bullseye          1.03GB
node                     slim              230MB
node                     alpine            165MB
```

Additionally, you can use [distroless](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless) base images. They contain only your app with its runtime dependencies. The package managers, shells, and others are skipped. Using them dramatically decreases the image size and its attack surface.     
This approach is more advanced and out of the scope of this article.

```
Size:
node-api     v2        408MB
Time:
Building 17.1s (12/12)
```

### 3. Multi-stage build

This allows you to separate the build and runtime envs. You can include only the essential files in the final image.

A Dockerfile accepts multiple [`FROM`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#from) statements. Each `FROM` instruction begins a new stage of the build (and can use a different base image). And each stage can be named with the `AS` keyword.

Here is my updated Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:alpine AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/node-api
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --verbose
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Prod stage
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/node-api
COPY --from=build /usr/src/node-api/build ./build
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --verbose

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

You can stop the build at a specific stage using the `--target` flag:
```sh
docker build --target build -t node-api:v3 .
```

```
Size:
node-api     v3        234MB
Time:
Building 8.6s (15/15)
```

### 4. Skip dev dependencies
Besides multi-stage, you can further skip dev dependencies during install.    

For Node, always use `ci` (clean install) instead of `i`. This command is more efficient and installs the exact versions based on `package-lock.json`. It throws an error and exits for any version mismatch. It also accepts an `--omit` flag to skip some dependencies.
```
RUN npm ci --omit=dev
```

```
Size:
node-api     v4        172MB
Time:
Building 6.3s (16/16)
```

### 5. Merge layers and cleanup between them

We can clean the temporary files that are created after a `RUN` instruction. It is common for package managers to install additional components and keep a local cache. We can save space by:
- Instructing the package manager to install the minimum dependencies
- Remove the cache after installation, or instruct the package manager to disable the cache altogether

For example, after installing Node dependencies, npm creates metadata files that take up space in the image. We can use these commands to remove them:
```
RUN npm cache clean --force
RUN rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/*
```

For **Debian/Ubuntu** use `--no-install-recomends`. It keeps the cache at `/var/lib/apt/lists`:
```
RUN apt-get install -y --no-install-recomends
RUN apt-get clean
RUN rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
<br />
For **Python (pip)**, we can specify the same with `--no-cache-dir`.

#### Limit the number of layers

Every instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image. Docker utilizes an overlay-type file system, stacking these layers cumulatively.       
In the above examples, even if we instruct to delete the files, **they are not deleted and the image size will not decrease**, so the disk space will not be returned.    

We can merge the `RUN` commands to avoid this.
If we do the cleanup before the `RUN` command is completed, the files we want deleted will not end up in the image:
```
RUN npm ci --omit=dev && \
    npm cache clean --force && \
    rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/*
```

```
Size:
node-api     v5        170MB
Time:
Building 6.7s (16/16)
```

## Summary

And my final Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:alpine AS build
WORKDIR /usr/src/node-api
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci && \
    npm cache clean --force && \
    rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/*i
COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY src ./src
RUN npm run build

# Prod stage
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/node-api
COPY --from=build /usr/src/node-api/build ./build
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --omit=dev && \
    npm cache clean --force && \
    rm -rf /tmp/* /var/cache/apk/*


CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Measuring image sizes
You can get the image size by listing the images:
```
docker images node-api
```
For more advanced insight, a useful tool is [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive):
```
dive node-api
```
It offers TUI for interactively exploring a Docker image. You can see each layer in detail, check for wasted space, and identify where you can further optimize.
It breaks down each layer including which files were added their size.

Alternatively, I found out you can just create the image without running it. Then, you can export its contents and inspect them manually:

```
docker create node-api:v5
docker container list -a
docker export <CONTAINER_NAME> > node-api.tar
```
Or:
```
docker export $(docker create node-api:v5) > node-api.tar
```
